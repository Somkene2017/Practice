### web_app URL = https://practice-sk.streamlit.app/

This web app simply takes user inputs and predicts whether it will rain or not.

These inputs are processed by a machine learning model I developed and saved as a .json file.

This app also collects the correct feedback from users to help confirm predictions and feed me with new set of data to train my ML model better.

### For a quick summary: 
#### 1. The model_pack.json is the file I created that holds the Machine learning model. 
#### 2. I trained the model locally on my computer with the weather_forecast.csv dataset before deploying it here at my Repo.
#### 3. The file web_app_2.py is the main python file that holds the codes of the web_app that Streamlit is hosted by Streamlit Cloud.
#### 4. If you want to replicate this code, go through the requirements.txt file to know the python packages that I used to develop this app
I am still modifying this app though.

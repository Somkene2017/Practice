This web app simply takes user inputs and predicts whether it will rain or not.

These inputs are processed by a machine learning model I developed and saved as a .json file.

This app also collects the coreecr feedback from users to help confirm predictions and feed me with new set of data to train my ML model better.

I am still modifying this app though.
